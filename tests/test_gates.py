"""The gates are tested for their ability to fail.

`RISK_REGISTER.md` B-1 names this as the mitigation for the project's structural risk — a solo
project with no second reviewer, where every finding so far was caught by a machine. That claim was
made before any such test existed, which made it the same class of defect the gates themselves
catch: a statement about the system that reads as true and is not.

A gate that has never been seen red proves nothing. Each case below builds a minimal fixture tree,
introduces one specific defect, and asserts the gate reports **that** defect — not merely that it
exited non-zero, which a crash would also do.

Fixtures live in `tmp_path` and the gates are pointed at them with `SWINGDESK_ROOT`. Nothing here
mutates the real tree: a test that edited the repository and then failed would leave it dirty, and
the suite must never be able to do that.
